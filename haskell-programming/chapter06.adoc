== What are typeclasses


A declaration of a type defines how that type in particular is created.
A declaration of a typeclass defines how a setof types are consumed or used in computations.

Typeclasses are like interfaces.

? Typeclasses are a means of ad hoc polymorphism aka constrained polymorphism

Data classes implement Typeclasses  (synonym for implements is instantiates)

= Bool example

Why not use the Read Typeclass

= Eq
The function type does not implement `Eq

`Eq`, `Ord`, `Enum`, `Bounded`, `Read`, and `Show` we can derive without manually providing instance methods
