Functors are Combinators

fmap as generalization to map over lists

Functor::
    A functor is a way to apply a function over or around some structure that we donâ€™t want to alter

[source,haskell]
.Functor.hs
----
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
----

Or use the infix operator `<$>`

== Laws

Identity::
    `fmap id == id`

Composition::
    `fmap(f.g) == fmap f . fmap g`
